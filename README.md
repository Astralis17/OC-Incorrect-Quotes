# OC Incorrect Quotes Generator
A simple generator for Incorrect Quotes


### Credits
This project was made by Aurora([Astralis17](https://github.com/Astralis17) on GitHub, [@thethinkingaurora](https://www.tumblr.com/thethinkingaurora) on tumblr) and the concept/idea was thought up by Phoenix([@phoenixradiant](https://www.tumblr.com/phoenixradiant) on tumblr).


### Project
In it's current state the generator is just a python file, in the future it will be updated and ported to a website for easier use and use on mobile.
Adding more quotes is always welcome, the more the merrier, you can submit them using the GitHub issues feature or via my askbox on tumblr.
Submissions don't have to be preformatted, any format is welcome. Preformatted submissions are always nice though, look at the quotes section of the python file to see formatting and reverse engineer it or look at [[Formatting Quotes]]
