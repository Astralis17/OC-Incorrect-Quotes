# OC Incorrect Quotes Generator
A simple generator for Incorrect Quotes


### Credits
This project was made by Aurora([Astralis17](https://github.com/Astralis17) on GitHub, [@thethinkingaurora](https://www.tumblr.com/thethinkingaurora) on tumblr) and the concept/idea was thought up by Phoenix([@phoenixradiant](https://www.tumblr.com/phoenixradiant) on tumblr).


### Project
In it's current state the generator is just a python file, in the future it will be updated and ported to a website for easier use and use on mobile.
Adding more quotes is always welcome, the more the merrier, you can submit them using the GitHub issues feature or via my askbox on tumblr.
Submissions don't have to be preformatted, any format is welcome. Preformatted submissions are always nice though, look at the quotes section of the python file to see formatting or follow the guide later in this file.


### Formatting Quotes
There are a number of things when formatting quotes for use, such as charactercase of names, names themselves and line breaks

For example
Here is a formatted and unformatted quote

##### Unformatted
Person 1: What's going on? 

Person 2 chuckling nervously: I don't know what you're talking about. Everything is completely 
normal and Person 3 is exactly where they're supposed to be

Person 1: What do you mean? WHERE IS PERSON 3

##### Formatted
P1, ": What's going on?", "&", P2, " chuckling nervously: I don't know what you're talking about. Everything is completely normal and ", P3, " is exactly where they're supposed to be", "&", P1, ": What do you mean? WHERE IS ", P3CAP


First thing you'll notice is the persons name is replaced by "P" with a following number

The "&", represents a line break

In order to make a name entirely uppercase simply add "CAP" to the end "P3" -> "P3CAP"

Make sure to add spaces in your strings to keep names and text separate (Although don't do so for your colons in order to keep them )
